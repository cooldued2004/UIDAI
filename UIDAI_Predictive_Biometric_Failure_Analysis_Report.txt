Problem Statement and Approach
A
adhaar biometric authentication serves as the primary
mode of identity verification for accessing welfare schemes
and essential public services. In practice, biometric authentica-
tion may fail due to worn fingerprints, aging-related degrada-
tion, sensor quality issues, or adverse operating environments.
Such failures often force citizens to rely on demographic au-
thentication or lead to repeated retries, increasing friction and
the risk of service denial.
Despite the operational importance of biometric failures,
public UIDAI datasets do not explicitly label authentication
attempts as failed. This limitation motivates a predictive
approach that infers biometric failure risk using indirect but
observable authentication behavior. Specifically, this work
models biometric stress through three dimensions: (i) loss of
biometric dominance, (ii) increased reliance on demographic
fallback authentication, and (iii) elevated authentication in-
tensity caused by repeated attempts. These dimensions are
combined into a composite risk score computed at the level of
date, state, district, and pincode, enabling UIDAI to proac-
tively identify high-risk regions and populations and intervene
before service denial occurs.
Datasets Used
The analysis exclusively uses Aadhaar datasets provided by
UIDAI, ensuring full compliance with hackathon requirements
and data governance norms.
TheBiometric Authentication Datasetprovides age-
wise counts of successful biometric authentications, which serve
as the basis for measuring biometric dominance and coverage.
TheDemographic Authentication Datasetrecords
authentication events completed using demographic attributes
when biometric authentication is not used, serving as a direct
observable proxy for biometric stress and fallback dependency.
TheEnrolment Datasetcontains age-wise enrolment
counts, enabling normalization of authentication activity and
construction of population-relative indicators such as authen-
tication intensity.
All datasets are aggregated by date, state, district, and
pincode. Age-group alignment is performed to ensure that
enrolment and authentication metrics correspond to the same
population segments.
Methodology
This section details the complete analytical pipeline used to
infer biometric authentication failure risk in the absence of
explicit failure labels.
Data Integration and Aggregation.The biometric, demo-
graphic, and enrolment datasets were merged using common
geographic and temporal keys. Due to the transactional na-
ture of authentication logs, multiple records may exist for
the same location and date. These records were aggregated
using summation to obtain total authentication volumes and
enrolment counts per unit of analysis.
The analysis focuses on the 18+ age group, which represents
the majority of Aadhaar-based service usage and exhibits
higher biometric variability due to aging and occupational
factors.
Core Metric Construction
Let B18+ denote biometric authentications, D18+ demo-
graphic (fallback) authentications, and E18+ the enrolled
population for a given unit.
Total authentication demand is defined as:
T18+ =B 18+ +D 18+
Biometric dominance is captured through biometric share:
Biometric Share= B18+
T18+
Fallback dependency is measured as:
Fallback Dependency Ratio= D18+
T18+
Authentication intensity, capturing retry behavior and fric-
tion, is defined as:
Authentication Intensity= T18+
E18+
Authentication intensity is normalized to ensure compara-
bility across regions.
Significance Statement
Biometric authentication failures within the Aadhaar ecosystem
can result in denial of essential public services, particularly
for elderly citizens, manual laborers, and populations with de-
graded biometric quality. As public UIDAI datasets do not
explicitly record biometric failure events, this study proposes
a predictive, risk-based framework that infers biometric stress
using indirect but observable authentication indicators. By
combining biometric dominance, demographic fallback depen-
dency, and authentication intensity into a composite risk score,
the framework enables UIDAI to proactively identify high-risk
regions and populations and deploy alternate authentication
mechanisms such as OTP or Iris before service denial occurs.
The team jointly conducted data integration, feature engineering, and biometric risk modeling.
All team members contributed to problem formulation, interpretation of analytical results, and
preparation of the final report.

Composite Risk Score and Categorization.A weakly super-
vised biometric failure risk score is constructed as a weighted
combination of interpretable authentication stress indicators:
Risk Score= 0.5×Fallback Dependency Ratio+0.3×(1−Biometric Share)+0.2×Normalized Authentication Intensity
The resulting continuous risk score is discretized into
three operationally meaningful categories to support decision-
making by UIDAI:
•Low Risk:Risk Score<0.3
•Medium Risk:0.3≤Risk Score<0.6
•High Risk:Risk Score≥0.6
Each risk category is directly mapped to a recommended
UIDAI operational response, ensuring that analytical outputs
translate into actionable interventions.
Risk Level Recommended UIDAI Action
Low Normal biometric authentication flow
Medium Prepare and prioritize fallback authentication
mechanisms
High Proactively enable OTP or Iris authentication to
prevent service denial
Data Analysis and Visualisation
This section presents key analytical findings derived from the
constructed biometric failure risk indicators. The visualisa-
tions illustrate how fallback dependency, biometric dominance,
authentication intensity, and regional variation collectively ex-
plain biometric stress patterns across Aadhaar authentication
systems.
Fig. 1.Distribution of Aadhaar Biometric Failure Risk Levels (18+). A significant
proportion of pincodes fall under medium and high risk categories, highlighting the
need for proactive authentication planning.
Fig. 2.Relationship between fallback dependency ratio and biometric failure risk score.
Higher reliance on demographic authentication strongly correlates with increased
biometric stress, validating fallback usage as a primary failure proxy.
The combined evidence from these visualisations demon-
strates that biometric failure risk is not uniformly distributed
and is strongly influenced by fallback dependency, biomet-
ric dominance, and authentication friction. These insights
support data-driven, region-specific policy and operational
decisions by UIDAI.
All analyses and visualisations were conducted using
Python, with complete code and derived metrics provided
in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.

Regions with higher biometric dominance exhibit lower failure risk, emphasizing the
protective role of robust biometric coverage.
